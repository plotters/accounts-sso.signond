Building signond can be done by typing these commands:

  qmake [options]
  make
  make install

Note that the "make install" command will probably require root permission in
order to install the files into the root filesystem.

The options recognized by the qmake command are:

  PREFIX=<install prefix>           (default is "/usr")
  LIBDIR=<library install prefix>   (default is "$PREFIX/lib" on 32bit machines and
                                     "$PREFIX/lib64" on 64bit machines)
  CONFIG+=coverage                  (enable test coverage reporting)
  CONFIG+=cryptsetup                (enable building the cryptsetup extension)

Example:
  qmake PREFIX=~ CONFIG+=cryptsetup
